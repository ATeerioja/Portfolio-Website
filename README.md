# Simple portfolio website for a student

The purpose of this website is to showcase my data-analytics and machine learning projects.
It is also used as a traditional portfolio website with the necessary components such as contact information.

This website is developed with Claude Sonnet 4.6 using the free tier as of now.
Although Claude is generating a large ammount of the base code, I am actively learning from the code and
learning the technologies that are used.

## Version 1.
- This version uses vanilla JS, HTML and CSS for the content layout and styling.
- Nginx is used to serve the static files and to cache the static assets.
- Docker is used to package the application so it can be easily transferred to the deployment environment among other benefits.
- Cloudflare is used for a custom domain name and SSL-certification.
- Fly.io is used to host the Docker container with their pay-as-you-go service being optimal for this small-scale application
- Github is used for sharing the development files and version control.
- Actions is used for CI/CD purposes to check if there are any leaked secrets and building and pushing the changes to Fly.io

## Version 2.
Now that the basic structure of the website is working I want to migrate the code to use React and Vite. React improves the modular structure so that building a larger website can be done more easily. Vite is used for production to see how the changes in the code change the website in almost real-time.

- React is used to manage the modular structure with components.
- Vite is used for seeing changes in the development environment in almost real-time.

This version also establishes (hopefully) the commit and branch structure of this project.
Moving forward the following prefixes are used to organize branches
feat/, fix/, chore/

The main branch is updated with a commit for v1.
The new branch is called feat/v2-react-vite
